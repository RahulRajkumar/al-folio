My [recent work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16429v1) on a direct p-adic analogue of the Wiener process is currently under review. The law for the Wiener process and the Laplacian (the associated infinitesimal generator) are both radially symmetric. It is well known that the multidimensional Wiener process decomposes as a Cartesian product of stochastically independent one-dimensional Wiener processes. We show that the process respecting the analogous symmetries in p-adic vector spaces fails to have this property. Moreoever, we contrast exit time statistics with a process that does not obey the same symmetries and exhibits qualitatively different behavior.
