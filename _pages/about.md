I am currently a second year Ph.D. student in the [UC Riverside Mathematics Department](https://mathdept.ucr.edu). I graduated from NYU with a [B.A. in Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/overview/), *magna cum laude*, in May 2020, through the College of Arts and Sciences [Honors Program](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/majors-minors/honors-programs/). Please see [my CV](assets/pdf/cv.pdf) for more details!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
