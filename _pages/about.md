I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the [UC Riverside Mathematics Department](https://mathdept.ucr.edu) under [Professor David Weisbart](https://the-weisbart-group.github.io/). I am broadly interested in Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. I work with stochastic processes valued in p-adic spaces, alternatives to the real numbers that naturally display hierarchical, ultra-metric structure. The overarching theme of my research program is the interplay between Brownian motions/diffusion processes and symmetry.

#### Education
- **Ph.D. in Mathematics**, *UC Riverside* (2020 - Present)
- **M.S. in Mathematics (Applied)**, *UC Riverside* (June 2023)
- **B.A. in Mathematics *(magna cum laude)***, *NYU* (May 2020)

For more information, please view [my resume](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).



#### Fun Fact About Me
In addition to pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematics, I perform in the [UC Riverside Concert Band](https://music.ucr.edu/concert-band) on the bassoon, and am classically trained on the alto saxophone.

#### Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion

I believe that mathematics is one of humanity's great achievements, comparable to the study of great literature from the world over. As such, no one should be excluded from learning about mathematics. I support DEI organizations including [Spectra](http://lgbtmath.org/): The Association for LGBT Mathematicians and the [Association for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
