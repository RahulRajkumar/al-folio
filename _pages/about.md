I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [UC Riverside Mathematics Department](https://mathdept.ucr.edu) under [Professor David Weisbart](https://the-weisbart-group.github.io/). I am broadly interested in Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. My current work is focused on the interplay between Brownian motions/diffusion and symmetry. 

In May 2020, I graduated from the NYU College of Arts and Sciences [Honors Program](https://math.nyu.edu/dynambic/undergrad/ba-cas/majors-minors/honors-programs/) with a [B.A. in Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/overview/), *magna cum laude*.

#### Fun Fact About Me
In addition to pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematics, I perform in the [UC Riverside Concert Band](https://music.ucr.edu/concert-band) on the bassoon. I am classically trained on the alto saxophone.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
