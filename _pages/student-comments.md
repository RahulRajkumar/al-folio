*Rahul did a great job TAing Math 121. He was super helpful during office hours. I also liked how he changed the approach to the class when he saw we were struggling and asked what we preferred to do for the worksheets. I also like how engaging he made the discussion session*

*The best and most productive discussion class iâ€™ve ever had because of Rahul*

*Mr. Rahul did a remarkable job explaining the complicated concepts taught during the lectures. He always provided a great learning environment.*

*Despite the large amount of materials the Student instructor had to cover, Rajkumar was very helpful and very well knowledge to the point of providing very understandable answers, making his classes very helpful when covering course material.*

*The instructor made lessons easy to understand, since I'm a visual learned, being able to see problems written out, I was more comfortable grasping complex concepts. The instructor was straightforward in lectures and explained in detail to students who didn't quite understand concepts fully*

*Rahul has been one of my favorite math T/A's that I have had. He had a great understanding of the course materials, and presented it well. His explanations were always clear and concise, and he responded to student questions very well. He took time outside of discussion to consider and respond to questions that students had. I greatly appreciate his teaching throughout the quarter, and I hope to have him again for another class.*

*Rahul is the most helpful TA I have ever had. He is very helpful and explains the content very good and in a way that is easy to understand. He is very understanding and always answers any questions we have. His ability to teach the discussion worksheet is amazing and he helps tremendously with the homework, quizzes and exams by explaining the content so well.*
