While at UCR, I have been a Teaching Assistant for a variety of upper and lower division mathematics courses. In Fall 2022, I served as a primary instructor for the UCR Math 5A: The Principles of Calculus I. The Math 5 sequence is part of a project to reimagined calculus and pre-calculus education, supported by the California Learning Lab through [A New Mathematics Gateway](https://calearninglab.org/project/a-new-mathematics-gateway/). {::comment} Please see [here]() for a pdf of select student comments from anonymous instructor evaluations.{:/comment}

For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
